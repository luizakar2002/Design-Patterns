# Design Patterns Library - C++ Implementations

## Overview

This project is a **collection of classic design pattern implementations** based on the most authoritative reference, the "Gang of Four" (GoF) Design Patterns book.  
Implemented entirely in **modern C++**, the goal was to deeply understand the inner mechanics of these patterns and create reusable, well-documented examples.

## Implemented Patterns

- **Builder Pattern**:  
  - Constructs complex objects step-by-step, separating construction logic from the final representation.
- **Decorator Pattern**:  
  - Dynamically adds behavior to objects without modifying their underlying code.
- **Factory Pattern**:  
  - Provides a method to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.
- **Prototype Pattern**:  
  - Creates new objects by copying an existing instance, useful for creating customizable and efficient clones.
- **Singleton Pattern**:  
  - Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

Each pattern is implemented in **pure C++**.
